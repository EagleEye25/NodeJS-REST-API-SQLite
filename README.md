# NodeJS REST API SQLite

This project is a proof of concept (POC).  
It's purpose is to demonstrate an implementation of a NodeJS REST API using SQLite as a database (sqlite.db).   
The code is written in ES6 and uses Promises.

## Installation :

1. Clone this repository : `git clone https://github.com/romwaldtff/NodeJS-REST-API-SQLite.git`  
2. Then install its dependencies : `npm install`

## Requirements :

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test the API.

## Getting started :

0. Install this application (See Installation).
1. Start the server with : `node index.js`
2. Connect Postman to the API at : `http://localhost:3000`
3. Try the different routes of the API (For more details, see the [documentation](https://github.com/romwaldtff/NodeJS-REST-API-SQLite/wiki)).

Alternatively, you can use `node index.js YOUR_PORT_NUMBER` to start the server with a specific port.
